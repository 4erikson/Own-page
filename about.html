        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p> I’m Arnold Davidson, an award-winning architect and a spatial planner. I now run my own architecture studio in New York, but previously I’ve worked internationally on a wide range of projects. My biggest passion is to marry the highest quality materials with function, achieving not just comfort but also the right aesthetic.</p> 

        <p> Over the years, I have developed a reputation for questioning the status quo. Innovation is in my blood. While I do celebrate the classic function of buildings and spaces, I’m not afraid to use materials that would otherwise go unused in spaces that would otherwise go unseen. So, if you want to work together and see more of that, you know where to find me.</p>

        <h3>Employment</h3>
        <p>Head of Architecture / 2018-2020 / Arnold Davidson Architecture, New York, USA</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, I’ve built my own architecture studio up. From just one person to a team of 12 now, Arnold Davidson Architecture stands for balance, integrity, and quality. We never compromise on two things: durability and comfort. Working with high-quality materials helps us achieve both. Spaces are meant for people, and not vice-versa – that’s our guiding principle whatever project we work on.</p>

        <p>Senior Industrial Architect / 2014-2018 / LCArchitects, New York, USA</p>
        <p>LCArchitects is one of the most innovative officers in New York and I was ecstatic to be part of it. It has shaped my spatial planning career as I got to work with not only industrial spaces, but also public ones. Figuring out the flows of people, while challenging at first, is now one of my absolute strongpoints. At LCArchitects, I worked on the TXK’s new neighborhood planning and Ohio Wood Company’s headquarters.</p>

        <h4>What clients say about me</h4>
        <q>Arnold is relentless in his approach. Once he has a plan, he will work at it until exact precision is achieved. Form his blueprints, to the renders and then the actual results – the consistency he and his team is able to achieve is just remarkable.</q>
